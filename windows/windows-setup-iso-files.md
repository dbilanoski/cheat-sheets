# How to download Windows ISO files

Since Microsoft is forcing Media Creation tool for prepairing bootable drives for Windows installation, web page where ISOs are available won't present option to download the ISOs, just the Media Creation tool.

But in case you open the [download images site](https://www.microsoft.com/hr-hr/software-download/windows10) on mobile phones, those buttons will become available. So here we are going to force the mobile layout of the webpage to grant access to those download buttons.

## Procedure

1. Visit link below or google "download windows setup iso"
 https://www.microsoft.com/hr-hr/software-download/windows10

2. Open the webpage in a mobile layout
	* For Chrome, press F12 to get to the Developer Tools > toggle "mobile device" button > choose any mobile phone from the dropdown on the left > F5 to reload the page so you get it in the mobile layout.
	   
3. Chose Windows edition, language and architecture and proceed to download the image.
