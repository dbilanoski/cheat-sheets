## Mocking Files In Memory
### Creating an In-Memory Excel File from a DataFrame

You can create a DataFrame and use the `BytesIO` object as a file-like buffer to save the Excel content.

### Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
})

# Create a BytesIO buffer to hold the Excel file in memory
excel_buffer = BytesIO()

# Write the DataFrame to this in-memory Excel file (buffer)
with pd.ExcelWriter(excel_buffer, engine='xlsxwriter') as writer:
    df.to_excel(writer, index=False)

# To simulate reading it back into a DataFrame (like for testing):
excel_buffer.seek(0)  # Rewind the buffer to the beginning
df_read = pd.read_excel(excel_buffer)

# Use pandas.testing to compare the original and the read DataFrame
pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(df, df_read)
```


### Explanation:

- **`BytesIO`**: Acts as an in-memory buffer that mimics file-like behavior, avoiding the need for actual disk IO.
- **`ExcelWriter`**: Writes the DataFrame to the Excel format using the `xlsxwriter` engine.
- **`excel_buffer.seek(0)`**: Resets the buffer pointer to the beginning so the data can be read back.
- **`pandas.testing.assert_frame_equal`**: A useful function for unit testing, allowing you to verify that the original and read DataFrames are equal.

You can now use this in-memory Excel file in your unit tests without creating any files on disk.
