## Automated Call Distribution Basics

### Skill

A **Skill** represents the expertise required to handle a specific type of call (e.g., language, product knowledge). Agents are assigned skills, and calls are routed to agents with the matching skill.

### Split

A **Split** is a group of agents sharing the same skill. It’s where calls are queued when no agent is immediately available. The term is often interchangeable with **Skill Group**.

### Vector

A **Vector** is a predefined call routing script that determines how a call is handled once it reaches the system. It can route calls based on conditions like time, customer input, or agent availability.

### VDN (Vector Directory Number)

A **VDN** is a virtual number that directs incoming calls to a **Vector**. It serves as the entry point for external calls into the contact centre system.

### Simplified Flow
- A customer dials a customer support number, which is routed to a **VDN**.
- The **VDN** invokes a **Vector**, which determines the routing logic (e.g., language selection, call priority).
- The call is routed to a **Split** (skill group) of agents with the appropriate **Skill** to handle the query.

## Dialers

A dialer is an application that automatically dials and calls for a number, and then delivers each call to a call center agent. Its function is to automate outbound call.

### Manual Dialer
* Agent manually calls the customers.
* Not automated.

### Preview Dialer
Automated dialer in which an agent can check information about the contact before dialing.
* Useful if the issue requires some degree of preparation for performing the call.
* Recommendable for queries that are not within a call centre script and demand preparation from the agent.

Can work in one of two ways:
1. The agent previews the information for a pre-determined period and the dialer automatically dials after the time ends.
2. The agent previews the information for an undetermined period of time and chooses when to dial.

### Power Dialer
This type of dialer automatically dials and distributes calls which are answered to an agent.
* Works by connecting agents only to calls that are answered by people.
* Dials a number instantly after a call is finished maximizing the number of calls an agent can make in a given period.
* Unwanted calls are not delivered to any agents, so there’s no time wasted on busy signals, invalid numbers, disconnected lines, or voicemail answers.

Recommendable for sales, marketing campaigns, or follow-up calls. It’s widely used for telemarketing and cold calling.

### Predictive Dialer
 More sophisticated type of auto-dialer that anticipates when agents will be available and adjusts the dialing rate accordingly.
* It dials more numbers than there are available agents, assuming that a certain percentage of calls won’t be answered. 
* This feature helps keep a near-continuous flow of calls, and it also intelligently manages call queues so that high-priority calls are dialed first.
* Feeds on statistics, calculating the right number of dials to have every agent on the line with shorter breaks between calls. For instance, if the call center’s data show that an average call typically lasts 60 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 50 seconds.

Recommendable for telemarketing, short calls, surveys, and in any situation that benefits from a rapid dial rate.

## Glossary

### DTMF
Dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) is the sounds or tones generated by a telephone when the numbers are pressed. These tones are transmitted with the voice channel and are used to control automated equipment and signal user intent, such as the number they wish to dial, or navigating IVR menus. 

DTMF specifies eight different tones. They are divided into a high group and a low group. Each key press corresponds to two tones - hence the name _dual tone_ - one from the high group and one from the low group. This allows for 16 total keys.

These keys are specified as the numbers 0 through 9, * (asterisk or star), # (pound, hash or octothorpe) and the letters A through D. The letter keys are not generally used and are omitted from the vast majority of consumer telephones.
