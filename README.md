# Cheat Sheets & Notes

A practical, growing collection of technical documentation, command references, code snippets and personal notes gathered through hands-on work in IT operations, system administration and automation.

## What you'll find here

The content focuses more on **practical usage**, less on theory-heavy explanations. Most notes originate from real production issues, panic-last-minute learning, troubleshooting sessions, automation work or day-to-day system administration tasks.

Topics may include:
- Operating systems & command-line tooling
- Scripting and automation notes
- Networking and infrastructure basics
- Deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting references
- General problem-solving notes I want to be able to reuse quickly

The structure evolves over time as the collection grows and gets refined.

## Why this exists

Over the years, I’ve written a large amount of internal documentation, guides and notes while supporting complex environments. This repository is my effort to:

- Consolidate that knowledge into a single, searchable place  
- Make my notes reusable for future projects  
- Share practical references that might help others facing similar problems

## Work in progress

Content is continuously added, reorganized, and refined as I migrate notes from other systems and expand the collection.

If something looks incomplete, it probably is 😊
